Simply lots of functions deriving lots of useful (or useless) metrics from text. In order to create valuable scores -- more statistics or linguistic exploration is needed. 

Nonetheless, some metrics are quite consistent and very computationally cheap (use of connectives, word count, sentence variation). Noun ratio, adjective ratio, content word ratio are nice metrics. LIX is canonical readability index for Scandinavian languages. 
This might be something to look into to create feed into LLM to improve scoring consistency.
